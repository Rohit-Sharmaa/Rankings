<h1>Rankings</h1>
<hr><p>Rankings is a system designed to aggregate and analyze user profile data from multiple coding platforms. It aims to provide insights and recommendations to users for improving their skill development based on their performance across these platforms.</p><ul>
<li>The project addresses the problem of fragmented skill development tracking across multiple coding platforms. By aggregating and analyzing user data from various sources, it provides a unified view of performance metrics, helping users identify strengths and weaknesses, receive tailored recommendations, and track their progress more effectively.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The purpose of our project is to create a unified platform that consolidates user profile data from various coding platforms. By analyzing this data, the project aims to provide personalized insights and recommendations, helping users improve their coding skills more effectively and track their progress across different platforms.</li>
