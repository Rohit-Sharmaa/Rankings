- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Visualize coding stats, rankings, and performance metrics.
- **Personalized Insights**: Access visual data based on your coding activity and progress.
- **Upcoming Contests**: Stay updated with the latest contests from various coding platforms.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your progress over time and work towards achieving your goals.
- **Google Authentication**: Integrate with Google for seamless profile synchronization using signup and login.
- **Sign Up With OTP Verification**: Register and verify accounts using OTP for enhanced security.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **APIs**: Integration with coding platforms (e.g., LeetCode, CodeChef, GeekForGeeks, Codeforces)
